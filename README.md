# Pyrat Room Exploitation Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts used to exploit the `Pyrat` room from TryHackMe. These scripts assist in fuzzing endpoints and cracking passwords to gain administrative access to the machine.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. `endpoints.py`
This script is used to fuzz potential endpoints on the vulnerable web server.

### 2. `passwords.py`
This script is used to brute-force for the admin password for the web server.

### 3. `revshell.txt`
This is the python one-liner for gaining a reverse shell

#### Usage:

-python endpoints.py
-python passwords.py
